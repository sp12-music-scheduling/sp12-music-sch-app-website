        A music scheduling app for Senior Project (CS 4850) Fall 2022 in collaboration

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p class = "descriptions readability">Currently, Professor Lindsey, a trumpet professor of the Department of Music at KSU, is currently using an application called GOLD to schedule routine practices for his students. The GOLD has limitations that he would like to improve on in our design of a similar application. In our application, we will implement a design that allows Professor Lindsey to manage his classes without having to go into each studentâ€™s account to add practices and provide automation such as setting an algorithm for weekly practice progression. Our main goal in our design is to provide a simple user experience that will save the professor time and be beneficial to his students. </p>
